## System Test
We are using COTS UE and in Intel 13900k CPU to perform a benchmark. We focus on the relative factors in our end-to-end 5G platform using USRP N310 as gNB:

- Bandwidth: Optional: 106,162 and 273 RBs

- SRS period: 80,40,20,10 ms

- Antenna and ports: 1,2,4 for each

We evaluates the data consistency and the stable running time and the packet drop rate.
